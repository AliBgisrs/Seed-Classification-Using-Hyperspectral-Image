If you have a hyperspectral image of seeds and need to classify them based on size, using this tool would be helpful.

Using this tool is very straightforward. Simply follow these steps:

Download the tool and unzip it.
Open it in ArcGIS Pro.
Assign your hyperspectral image as input (the image should be in .bil format).
Choose an output location to save the geodatabase of the results.
Run the tool.
Review the results.
Open the results layer in ArcMap.
Apply symbology based on the area to classify the seeds by size.
These steps will help you easily classify seeds based on their size using the tool.

If you have a bunch of images and you want to do the same for all images, use the SeedClassificationBatch.atbx tool.
